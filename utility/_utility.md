# bets type explanation:

- h2h (head to head / moneyline):

    Head to head betting is a form of sports betting whereby the bookmaker creates a market for the two possible outcomes of a match: Team A win or Team B. It is the most popular form of sports betting. In some cases, head to head bets involve three outcomes; an example of a sport where three outcomes is a distinct possibility is soccer, where the draw can be as likely as any other result.

    Head to head betting is the most popular type of sports bet offered throughout the world. It purely focuses on the win or loss outcome of a match. Head to head bets are also very popular in tennis, where there can only be two outcomes: Player A or Player B.

- totals (over/under):

    An over/under in sports betting is a wager on the total number of points in a game. It’s also called “the total.”

    A bettor can wager on whether or not the combined points/goals/runs scored by both teams will go over or under a predetermined amount. You’re not trying to guess the exact amount.

    Let’s say the Bills–Chiefs total is 54.5, a high total for the NFL due to the offenses involved:

    If Buffalo wins 24-20 (44 points), under bettors win
    If Buffalo wins 34-24 (58 points), over bettors win

- outrights (futures):

    Outright bets are the simplest of all bet types. They can refer to a number of different wager types, but most commonly, an outright bet is when a punter backs a team or player to be the overall winner of a competition or event.

    Examples include betting on a team to win the English Premier League or an individual to win a tennis tournament, such as Wimbledon.

    When a punter places an outright bet on a team or player, they will be paid out on a winning bet after the competition has concluded, or the outcome they have predicted has come to fruition.

    Therefore, if somebody places a bet on the winner of the EPL at the beginning of the season in August, they will usually get their winnings when the season has concluded the following year.

    However, punters are not restricted to placing outright bets only before an event or competition has started, and prices can fluctuate once a tournament is underway.

    For example, at Euro 2020 the odds of Italy winning the tournament got smaller after they had won their first three matches against Turkey, Switzerland and Wales.

    This is because by winning these games, they progressed to the knockout stage of the competition and their chances of lifting the trophy increased.
